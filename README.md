# Python Sorting
This is my first python project and it is pretty useful if you download a lot of files.
It sorts your dowloaded files into diffrent folders depending on the extension.
In the config file you can specify the user that you want the folder to be sorted.
You have to put the config file into the same folder as the python file.
